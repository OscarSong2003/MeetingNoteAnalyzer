# Audio/Meeting Notes Analyzer


- A simple interface that allows the user to record one/multiple voices
- Uses Django as backend framework, and Forte to conduct processing. Also uses google speech to text recognition API to transcribe text. 
- Conducts speaker segmentation to identify speakers. 
- Uses Stave to display the annotations 
- Front end is built using React, React-Bootstrap, React-voice-recording library, and Chokra UI

# To start: 
1: Clone Repository 
2: Set up virtual environment: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html (Command: virtualenv venv p=python3.8.5)
   NOTE: make sure to specify python version
2: Navigate to frontend and pip install libraries specified in requirements.txt 
3: Navigate into backend and npm install packages from package.json
4: In frontend directory: run npm run start to start server on localhost:3000
5. In backend directory: run python manage.py runserver to start backend 

# Restrictions
1: Currently the analysis cannot handle very large/long audio files as it would require the use of cloud storage and asynchronous requests (user can implement this on top of current implementation if necessary) 
2: Feel free to checkout the branch google-api-method if you wish to use your own api key (currently uses default generated by python library. 
3: Additional optimizations can be made on recognition and NER.
